4,Really buggy and terrible to use as of recently,NEGATIVE,-1
5,Dear Spotify why do I get songs that I didn't put on my playlist??? And why do we have shuffle play?,NEGATIVE,-1
6,The player controls sometimes disappear for no reason. App restart forgets what I was playing but fixes the issue.,NEGATIVE,-1
7,I love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!,POSITIVE,-1
8,"Still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. I'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done NOTHING to solve it! Over time I have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). And please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.",NEGATIVE,-1
9,"It's a great app and the best mp3 music app I have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful I recommend it. it's just the best.",POSITIVE,-1
10,"I'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: This app now has a failing business model. Whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. Closed the app during ad number 6, and I'm more patient than most. If those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. All that's left is your decline.",NEGATIVE,-1
11,Can't play Spotify when on WiFi,NEGATIVE,-1
12,"I had amazon premium music family package and it was good. Everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. We now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. It just doesn't like spotify. It just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. Why isn't the integration better?",NEGATIVE,-1
13,Worst app always says I'm offline and never showed any song or podcast,NEGATIVE,-1
14,i hav any music that i like it is superðŸ™Œ,POSITIVE,-1

19,I know ads are the cost to free use And yes thats all right But 3 ads straight back to back Like for 1 and a hlaf minutes sometimes Don't you think that's a little much ? And even the volume increases just for the Ads.,NEGATIVE,-1

21,His voice is so sweet and hearable,POSITIVE,-1
22,"I logged out on my acc but when I tried to open it to log in, it won't open.. all I see is the logo",NEGATIVE,-1
23,"usually I love the app, but I'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. Random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently I can't view the song or podcast I'm currently playing so I can't pause or skip back and forth. It's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service.",NEGATIVE,-1

31,The best music app ever I have seen,POSITIVE,-1
32,"WOW!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. Even though I'm 100% positive it is correct. This morning my app asks me to login? Why? This hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. Just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into Spotify on my Xbox is suspicious!? Thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. I won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.",NEGATIVE,-1

39,Wide range of songs collection,POSITIVE,-1
40,"What's the deal here? Compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! Why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? Is there more that need to be said about this? I think I made my point clear enough!",NEGATIVE,-1

49,love most of the features in the app but one thing is a bit expensive at each month subcription for $9.90,NEGATIVE,-1

58,Spotify is better than joox fosho,POSITIVE,-1
59,"Since Disney started to pay for ads for Disney+, the non-premium version of Spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from Disney+ and sometimes one more. I will change my review if I won't get so many ads.",NEGATIVE,-1

65,"It was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?",NEGATIVE,-1
66,"I love it soo much and I will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore",NEGATIVE,-1

71,"Had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it. As someone else said before, there is now no player so can't skip, pause etc. Not sure if this is because I'm on a Samsung Galaxy? As it does come back briefly if I restart my phone ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸",NEGATIVE,-1

82,Please turn off shuffle play!!!,NEGATIVE,-1
83,"Its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .It has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",POSITIVE,-1
84,In the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. You have to go into the app and play the song again.,NEGATIVE,-1

86,I hate this If i have spotify free i can only listen to the half of the song on mobile hate this f#$Ã— u,NEGATIVE,-1
87,"I uninstalled this app because I don't have any use for it anymore and as soon as I did that, the ads for it appeared on YouTube videos Just how freaking desperate do you have to be to promote it this much Please buzz off",NEGATIVE,-1
88,"I love Spotify, I listen more and more, music an podcasts. We have a premium account, it's worth every penny.",POSITIVE,-1
89,"What the hell? I'm having the same issue as ""The Patoto Man"", minus random songs being added. I can't even choose any song at all that I want to play. I can't view them properly, I can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. I can't even listen to any music I want, and can't even have playlists play the music I want. And the big one, it all seems to just be a Samsung/ Google Play Store issue. I can play just fine on Apple mobile devices like iPads.",NEGATIVE,-1
90,This app is good but fixe it i can't sign in,NEGATIVE,-1
91,"Dude the app is good and all but just today I was using it and later in the day I check it and it won't let me play my playlist, and random songs are added toy playlist I can't even select a song I want to play I can only listen to it for a short period of time, and it says ""you added"" in your playlist and then bottom part says ""we added"" I don't know what to do I just want to listen to the full songs without random bots adding random songs that I don't even like and have any interest.",NEGATIVE,-1

93,It's awesome and great music app,POSITIVE,-1
94,Works super well.... When it works... The app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. Ultra laggy. Locks up my phone occationally... Makes no sense. Otherwise. Features are plentiful and you can find most anything.,NEGATIVE,-1

98,"I love listening to music (I use it as a coping mechanism), so I love Spotify so much too. But, about 3 days ago (?), my Spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. Tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and I still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",NEGATIVE,-1
99,"Used to be good. It dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). I emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working.",NEGATIVE,-1
100,"For an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues I have is frustrating. Like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though I allow background data use and all that. At times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and I have to open it independently, then I have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so I must force close it.",NEGATIVE,-1

104,Love spotify great for all the family,POSITIVE,-1
105,"This app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. This means that I have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. Hope spotify will fix their broken app soon.",NEGATIVE,-1
106,"I use to love this app, but I soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, I've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar Songs when your playlists ends. Something like that ) but it doesn't work, I don't recommend.",NEGATIVE,-1
107,Excellent music experience,POSITIVE,-1
108,This is an amazing app I use it all the time and it's very affordable. If you are looking for a app to lift your mood Spotify it the one you go for.,POSITIVE,-1
109,Spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. It's so easy to use but there's still so many features and I honestly didn't realize how much I needed it until I got it. Would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. GET SPOTIFY!!! (I do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.,POSITIVE,-1
110,Sometimes it is not working,NEGATIVE,-1
111,Very annoying and disturbing,NEGATIVE,-1
112,Good audio play experience with spotify.,POSITIVE,-1

117,"App stuck on loading black screen with Spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! Using Note 20 ultra",NEGATIVE,-1
118,"2022.07.08 Would like to be able to save queue as playlist. Would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. When playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",NEGATIVE,-1
119,"Worst app for music,so many ads.",NEGATIVE,-1
120,Best song app all over,POSITIVE,-1
121,"I love ðŸ’“ this app . It has ads but not that level, that's the reason. And you can choose your favorite artist. You can enjoy different Playlist in just 28 mb. And resso use 68 mb. So I prefer Spotify.",NEGATIVE,-1
122,Nice music quality,POSITIVE,-1
123,Umm... Lately There is Auto Pausing Problem when the screen Locks Hope It Will Fix Soon,NEGATIVE,-1
124,Amazing songs and artists!!! Great app 10/10 review!!,POSITIVE,-1
125,"Not bad but not good. I wanted to listen to a song that I like but suddenly it played a different song. I tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that I did not add on my playlist. Well, that's okay.",NEGATIVE,-1
126,"I absolutely love Spotify and I'm obsessed with music, but I only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. Ok so basically my Spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and I had no idea how to fix. And whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my Spotify account just not on my phone. So it might be my phone but idk. And another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. Well thats all I have",NEGATIVE,-1
127,I really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics ðŸ˜ it's amazing I love singing along with my favorite songs ðŸŽµ ðŸ’•,POSITIVE,-1

132,This is nice app i love spotify,POSITIVE,-1
133,Having streaming trouble with new update. Skipping of audio and app crashes,NEGATIVE,-1
134,"Easy play, and all singers and songs I wanted is here.Thank you",POSITIVE,-1
135,It's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy,POSITIVE,-1
136,The recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. Worst recommendations of all time. There is little to no effort put into these. If you made a playlist exclusively with 90's Norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest Island in the Sun by Weezer. The now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone,NEGATIVE,-1
137,I'm speechless this app is amazing.,POSITIVE,-1
138,I cant open the app ðŸ˜­ I've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help,NEGATIVE,-1
139,For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years,NEGATIVE,-1
140,"I have used this app for a few years now, Love it so much.",POSITIVE,-1
141,NICE ONE THANKS FOR YOUR HELP AND support,POSITIVE,-1
142,Have same issue as others... App keeps freezing and crashing. Is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?,NEGATIVE,-1
143,This is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if I could do 3000 out of 100000 I would give it a 100000000000000,POSITIVE,-1
144,"Please help me how do I fix this I can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, I tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. Fix this.",NEGATIVE,-1
145,All good but I don't like ads too much ads,NEGATIVE,-1
146,"Living remotely, Spotify is the only way to go. Love it.!!!",NEGATIVE,-1
147,"Itâ€™s the best App I have ever used for listening music. There are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.Spotify really knows me well. It creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. Artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. I like using Spotify. But I wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. For example skipping more than 6 songs.",POSITIVE,-1
148,So bad I just want my songs so when I made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song I rate one or zero,NEGATIVE,-1
149,The app is not working on moto g52 5g. The app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.,NEGATIVE,-1
150,Probably the best app I found in Play Store for music.I love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in Spotify because Spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid listeners I'll be amazing.,POSITIVE,-1
151,"A lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add.",NEGATIVE,-1
152,Love it but why did they add it where if I play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? I liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. I couldn't find a way to turn it off either. Love Mac DeMarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. Need an option to take it off. Ruins the aesthetic.,NEGATIVE,-1
153,"This is absolutely ridiculous. I lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. Severely unimpressed",NEGATIVE,-1
154,I can find most songs I love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.,POSITIVE,-1
155,It is a great music app it's my favorite and I know you will like it but one thing I don't like is you have limited amount of skips eatch hour and I recommend getting the app it's great to listening to songs with your friends and you :) and I love how you can make playlists I have one with over 50 songs!,POSITIVE,-1
156,"Love it. Sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. Love the blended mix between songs. Was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same.",NEGATIVE,-1
157,"I like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. Other than that this is a good app.",NEGATIVE,-1
158,"Best music app very good quality songs, they sometimes give 30mins without interruption, there are hundreds of not thousands of songs which are in high quality I really recommend downloading",POSITIVE,-1
159,Easy to opporate and the pmaylist it matches up foe me r spot in what i wanted to hear. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘,NEGATIVE,-1
160,can't like anymore songs,NEGATIVE,-1
161,this is sooooo annoying!!! its been 2 weeks music keeps on stopping after 1 second. 1 SECOND!?!?! is this what I get for paying??? come on! spotify. i've tried a lot of trouble shooting. *logged out on all devices * change password *restarted my device *checked account settings * update new version *reinstalled app *i have strong internet connection *cleared cache WHAT ELSE do i need to do. help me please. I really like this app but if this keeps going then goodbye!!!,NEGATIVE,-1
162,Very good and the exact app I was looking for. 1 star not given because of too many ads and some songs are not there.,NEGATIVE,-1
163,The golden standard. Get premium y'all. It's worth it.,NEGATIVE,-1
164,On time and always on point,POSITIVE,-1
165,Great music. Easy to use. Amazing selection variety!,POSITIVE,-1
166,"Slowly getting worse, my Spotify has been getting super buggy. A lot of random pauses and disconnects with my Tacoma. Bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and I could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. Had to restart my phone, a S10+.",NEGATIVE,-1
167,Like this app forever but the ads are disturbing ðŸ˜ pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and Spotify 4ever,NEGATIVE,-1
168,Works well for the most part. Hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.,POSITIVE,-1
169,"I have been using the app for podcasts, and I am enjoying it. However, some sometimes the media player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. To rectify this, I have to relaunch the app. Please see to this problem.",NEGATIVE,-1
170,"Why i am getting hindhi ads, which i could hardly understand, can't even you make advertisment based on the region of user, based on location access?",NEGATIVE,-1
171,"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this.",POSITIVE,-1
172,The only thing I don't like is I can't pick the song I want to play and I can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last,NEGATIVE,-1
173,Songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual,NEGATIVE,-1
174,"I don't know whats going on with this app, but I'm encountering so many problems now. The player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it VERY difficult. Never used to have these problems. Needs to be fixed for Android users.",NEGATIVE,-1
175,To many advertisements are there,NEGATIVE,-1
176,Too much add its to irritating,NEGATIVE,-1
177,"this app is getting more and more annoying, I can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, I waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. Fix your damn app",NEGATIVE,-1
178,Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.,NEGATIVE,-1
179,"This app is great in so many ways. But Jesus does it glitch. There's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. Extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. Please fix the bugs!!!!",NEGATIVE,-1
180,Worst Everytime I open it I can't play any song It says no internet connection even when I am connected to internet. It only works when my phone is connected to WiFi. That's not good at all,NEGATIVE,-1
181,They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.,NEGATIVE,-1
182,"I love this app but I wish we could have the option to turn off the ""we added"" part of MY playlist I'm don't want to listen to some random German song I can't understand when I'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs.",NEGATIVE,-1
183,Good app for listening music.,POSITIVE,-1

215,"I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. I only get previews of the songs. I can only get 6 skips per hour. I cant do anything i want. Almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. You put so many restrictions on us.

231,I love this app so much. I have been using Spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. I had an issue with swiching what device i was listening on but ir was easilly fixed.

236,Best app for streaming the latest music hands down. If you have Spotify Duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. I absolutely love Spotify. Highly recommended.,POSITIVE,-1
237,"Decent service... Except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! ðŸ˜µ I get you want people to pay for Premium but it's truly ridiculous. Used to really like Spotify. Now I just turned it on, it played ONE song, and then LITERALLY at least 8 (I lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds EACH. And not even the ""Enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening"" message so for all I know it'll be the same after the next song.",NEGATIVE,-1
238,"premium user for years. Spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but I'm thinking about switching. Never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago I switched to iPhone for the first time - still no problems. Switched back to Samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. You can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. It randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & It marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. Also a million pop ups.",NEGATIVE,-1
239,"This app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. Can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? This app isn't cheap, I expect it to be far better.",NEGATIVE,-1

244,"Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone.",NEGATIVE,-1
245,The quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times,POSITIVE,-1
246,I am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. I would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.,NEGATIVE,-1
247,This is the best music app ever. This is the one to rule them all. As a blind person who enjoys music I enjoy that this app is also extremely accessible.,POSITIVE,-1
248,Spotify is great! I love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.,POSITIVE,-1
249,I really like this app. But it's been acting up lately,NEGATIVE,-1

256,The best music selection and it's very easy to use,POSITIVE,-1
257,Apple music is worse. But better.,NEGATIVE,-1
258,"I love having MY music at my fingertips! I don't like when Spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. I know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. I get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. ðŸ˜‰ Other than that this is a great app!! Thank you!",POSITIVE,-1
259,Crashed & support doesn't give a damn. After contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have DOES NO DIFFERENCE.,NEGATIVE,-1
260,Their Is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to Spotify I don't have to only pick 1 I can pick 5 and Spotify finds them and gives them to me,POSITIVE,-1
261,I had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore,NEGATIVE,-1

267,"adds were never there and It should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. Not only r the adds unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how r u gonna tell me how many songs I can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. U can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control ur own playlist. My point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly",NEGATIVE,-1
268,"Rn I am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. I usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. If I play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. Or if I want to pause a song that is playing I'd have to close the app entirely. I have this problem whether I use my earbuds or not. I've never had this problem",NEGATIVE,-1
269,"Just to listen to a couple of short ads, I get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest Live Album ever: The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. It just doesn't get any better.",NEGATIVE,-1
270,Please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. Its extremely frustrating that all I can do is pause the music. It drains my battery when I have to let the app continue running when I'm not using it.,NEGATIVE,-1

272,Good free music. Easy to use.,POSITIVE,-1
273,"Used to be good, getting worse. Buttons disappeared. Not happy",NEGATIVE,-1
274,I love Premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering Sirius is like $5/month. If Premium was $5/month like Sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!,NEGATIVE,-1

285,Great app.too many commercials,NEGATIVE,-1
286,"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday.",NEGATIVE,-1
287,"To tell you the truth guys I preferred Spotify Stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. I hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though I'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. I hope I'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do I get it. Thanx for listening.",NEGATIVE,-1
288,"None of the music actually plays. The ads do, but never the music.",NEGATIVE,-1
289,"Good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall I love this app",POSITIVE,-1
290,Great! Love the content! But it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. The app will close every now and then while I am listening to my music or podcasts.,NEGATIVE,-1
291,"I don't like when I search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. It puts the song in a ""playlist"" that I don't want to hear.",NEGATIVE,-1
292,"Spotify was fine, I never paid to remove the ads because I don't mind them. The reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",NEGATIVE,-1
293,App performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of Ads and it is soo irritating so I am disliking it,NEGATIVE,-1
294,"Breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. Extremely annoying. Cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. Lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. Home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. Looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",NEGATIVE,-1

298,Awesome and amazing.,POSITIVE,-1
299,I love all the songs & artists on this app,POSITIVE,-1
300,"Edit: The SD Card trick from online forum works. App is working as intended. Still frustrating that you have to disconnect the SD card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. Mobile app does not work. I cannot play music or podcasts, I cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though I can see them on desktop and browser.",NEGATIVE,-1
301,"Not sure what's happened with this app. But it skips my songs all the time, just like a CD. I uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. Absolutely NO DIFFERENCE. I pay for premium and I'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. It used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. Very frustrated.",NEGATIVE,-1
302,"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.",POSITIVE,-1

324,"I hated iheartradio, so I am trying this. It is an improvement over iheart so far. However, some things could be streamlined better. An auto-download feature would be great, especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist. The ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option. Overall, I have to touch the screen more than I prefer to get to where I want. Updated 7/8/22: new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage.",NEGATIVE,-1
325,The new update is just horrible I don't like the fact that I NEED TO PAY TO LISTEN TO WHAT I LIKE it's absolutely infuriating and the offline update? You never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get,NEGATIVE,-1

328,"In my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists I make it reccomends the sake songs over and over and I don't even kind them and the genres they reccomend are completely unrelated to what I Listen to,I think they should add a feature where u can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesnt get reccomended to u again, but where u can still search it up or view it in a folder just incase",NEGATIVE,-1

I won't need to continue Spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so I can come back to enjoy my songs.",NEGATIVE,-1

353,I absolutely LOVE my spotify app! I have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add ANY song that plays from ANY station and/or other playlist to). I also love how Spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. And their is definetlely a HUGE variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its ALL 100% FREE! The ONLY thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,POSITIVE,-1

366,"Spotify is the best music app No doubt about it. But I have one request for Spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in English.

367,"I logged out of my Spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as I logged out Spotify has been broken. I've been met with nothing but a grey screen with the Spotify logo. I closed in and out. I waited over night, still didn't work. This morning I deleted it then re-downloaded it. AND IT STILL ISN'T WORKING??",NEGATIVE,-1
368,I don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when I really need it to work. My alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. I don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again,NEGATIVE,-1

383,Awesome music awesome app ðŸ˜Žâœ¨ðŸ’šðŸ,POSITIVE,-1
384,I love to listen to the music and podcasts.,POSITIVE,-1
385,"I don't want to see ""shows to try"" or ""episodes for you"" podcasts first in the front page. I really dislike the recommendations, often grotesque and straight up unamusing, so I would never, ever use Spotify to listen to podcasts. I don't pay premium for letting you shove those horrible shows at the beginning of the front page, I'm paying to have my MUSIC ad free.",NEGATIVE,-1
386,The app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music I recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice,POSITIVE,-1

391,"Let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! It's not accessible. I want to hear my GPS without having to pause playback multiple times. Everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it. Google apps can toggle ""allow external devices to start playback"" but that doesn't fix Spotify. Also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though I'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. Keep them separate.",NEGATIVE,-1
392,"I'm sick of it, Spotify, please stop adding songs to Play lists. I get. You want us to try something new but it's getting annoying",NEGATIVE,-1
393,"I don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till I updated my phone software. It is okay if I listening through my laptop, I think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. I rely on Spotify to listening music. I hope I can still use the app by phone since I use the app most of the time in it.",NEGATIVE,-1
394,The app requires updates too frequently. For the cost it should be more reliable.,NEGATIVE,-1
395,Love my Spotify App!!,POSITIVE,-1
396,"Went over to amazon music, complete trash, it was like a wish purchase compared to this",NEGATIVE,-1
397,"I like this app very much , but MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT : I THINK IT'S VERY STUPID THAT YOU HAVE TO SKIP TO YOUR FAVORITE SONG AND ALSO THAT YOUR SONG THAT YOU SEARCH IS SHUFFLED WITH OTHER SONGS!!!!!!",NEGATIVE,-1

401,"Not much interested, getting lots of advertisements",NEGATIVE,-1
402,"Edited: Reading through the reviews, just wondering has this company been sold to a venture capitalist? Everyone's mad at u guys. I'm sorry, I usually don't do this, but I have to edit my excellent rating I gave this app. Last few days have just been really bad. Right now I can't see my currently playing song. My queued up songs and that's making it difficult to use the app. Kindly correct this and I'm happy to return my previous excellent rating. Thanks . . . . . . Simply awesome ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ŒðŸ¿",NEGATIVE,-1
403,"Love Spotify generally, but reading reviews I've been suffering a problem that many others are experiencing. Function bar disappearing, not allowing me to pause etc, also affects pausing using my headphones. Music keeps stopping on its own accord. It is so frustrating!!!",NEGATIVE,-1
404,"Computer version is much better and has a repeating option. On phone app it doesn't work. You can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app",NEGATIVE,-1
405,"There are sooo many problems with Spotify, maybe because I use an android but it keeps on saying that there are connection problems and not letting me access anything, please find a way to allow other android users to make full use of this app",NEGATIVE,-1

412,My dudes i love you but i now cant listen to music when my phones locked. Please fix and ill change rating,NEGATIVE,-1
413,"Terrible experience for listening to podcasts, it never remembers last played position of a podcast, it doesn't sink between devices..i.e. my computer and phone.",NEGATIVE,-1
414,"Laggy, not as good as it was previous versions. I'm not a fan of the new changes, plus it won't let access songs when I'm offline, when half the time I'm just on cellular. Edit: still having the same problems since may 2022...why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems? I've mostly switched to a different podcast player, but still looking for a good alternative music player.",NEGATIVE,-1
415,Excellent app - can find almost anything,POSITIVE,-1
416,"It's a great app for listening music, I have playlists I've made as profile Cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. I have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income I can't afford to spend that much. Unfortunately you are pushing a political agenda with ads that I am sick of. Every time I listen anymore every single ad is for pro gay junk. I don't want ads for that. It's gotten so bad I can't even use this app anymore",POSITIVE,-1
417,I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.,POSITIVE,-1

Constantly freezing, can't even pause with my headphones when that happens. I have to completely close the app and restart it for it to start working.",NEGATIVE,-1
421,Such a rubbish app lots of advertisements i m going to uninstall this app ..,NEGATIVE,-1
422,Just had to sit through 6 adds straight as a free user only to it to play a completely different song than the one I clicked on.,NEGATIVE,-1
423,This app is a god damn mess. I pay for glinches apparently.,NEGATIVE,-1
424,Every time i want to listen to my fave songs i can listen to a few but after like 5 songs it changes to a totally other song,NEGATIVE,-1

438,I love Spotify. I can find anytjing I want to liaten to. They have any genre I want or if I want a podcast they have it!,NEGATIVE,-1
439,The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.,NEGATIVE,-1
440,"I love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...",NEGATIVE,-1
441,Very good app all genres and era of music Gave 4 stars not that there is an issue just that there is always room for some unknown improvement,POSITIVE,-1
442,Omg ðŸ˜ðŸ˜my fav app ever. It has really good qualityðŸ’‹ðŸ¥‚,POSITIVE,-1
443,"Clearly, this is an amazing app qith the best quality, the only thing i dont pike is that they dont offer all songs, but mist every app has this situation or maybe a worse one. So please, go ditch ur pandora and join spotify, it ia so worth it.",POSITIVE,-1
444,I have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.,NEGATIVE,-1

450,Great app find all songs i like and new ones but tired of being double charged for the premium package about to uninstall,NEGATIVE,-1
451,"It's a very good app for music...loved it a lot.. but today when I'm trying to open the app it's not working even after reinstallation, it's still not opening. Please fix the glitch",NEGATIVE,-1
452,this is fantastic app for old and newsing for singing,POSITIVE,-1
453,The 'What's playing' facility has disappeared. The most basic feature - gone. Not good enough.,NEGATIVE,-1
454,"I love your music ..thank you so much for sharing this ,great job..",POSITIVE,-1
455,Excellent music app,POSITIVE,-1
456,Works but feels rough and clitchy. Unbelievable that such a big brand like Spotify cannot make an app thats well intrgrated with a premium android device. This should be a AAA title. I'm using GalaxyS20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. Like pausing the music or controlling the app through galaxyBuds. Often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. AndoidAuto experience is even worse.,NEGATIVE,-1
457,"Thanks for dumping all my downloads without even telling me! Appreciate that! I also love how when I don't have cellular reception, you won't let me play the podcasts that I already downloaded. I also love how as time goes on the more glitchy and unreliable the app becomes. Thanks for letting me down, Spotify!",NEGATIVE,-1
458,Not happy with the hey Spotify thing. I don't like it taking away my control while I'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.,NEGATIVE,-1
459,Logedin on my family premium plane to listen to music on plan flight and loged out wen u landed and I now just can't get in I have uninstalled it 3 times and it won't work,NEGATIVE,-1
460,Lots of good music but lots of adds,POSITIVE,-1
461,Continually riddled with issues. Currently it will just quit playing on me. It does not seem like Spotify truly cares about customers through my experience I have continually felt ignored in that the issues are generally left unresolved for an excessive amount of time... Awesome to know it wasn't just my device because I just upgraded to the s22 ultra and the issues are still here with liked song filters like I've complained about for months,NEGATIVE,-1
462,"The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug.",NEGATIVE,-1
463,Better than the other satellite radio station offered. I like that you can customize your music. I have the premium subscription with no advertising great option.-,NEGATIVE,-1
464,"This app is great, if you are reading this you definitely need to download it",POSITIVE,-1
465,Still garbage. If I wasn't so deep into creating my library using Spotify I would use a different app. Constantly have to redownload everything for absolutely no discernable reason. App closed and reopened? Guess you're downloading your entire library for the third time this week.,NEGATIVE,-1
466,"I prefer free coz it always drive me crazy when i m choosing e wallet payment methode, gopay or telkomsel, all the same...",NEGATIVE,-1
467,"I'm giving this two stars for no other reason that Spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are ONLY on the app. Why can't I block artists on desktop? Why force me to use the app? I'd use it anyway, but making me HAVE to is just kinda butts.",NEGATIVE,-1
468,I pay money for this every month and it is garbage. I've loved Spotify for years. Now they can't get it right. I'm seriously about to end my subscription and switch.,NEGATIVE,-1
469,"This is mony app no install this app, wink is best and gana is best appðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’",POSITIVE,-1
470,doesn't go past the loading page,NEGATIVE,-1
471,The free trial is great and when thats over there are only a few adds that x o me between you are your music.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ŒðŸ¤ŒðŸ¤ŸðŸ‘,POSITIVE,-1
472,"WOW MANY SONG DJ, ROCK,ROMANTIC, WOW THIS IS SO SUPER APP",POSITIVE,-1
473,"I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better, To be honest Spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but YouTube Music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so I think it's not good as Spotify is, But to be honest again YouTube Music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for Music application YouTube music's free edition is better",NEGATIVE,-1
474,"Worst audio quality in the market. It's more a social network, if you really like music this is not your app.",NEGATIVE,-1
475,Everything's fine about Spotify but the shuffle option often repeats tracks. Please improve shuffle option,POSITIVE,-1
476,Very poor when offline,NEGATIVE,-1
477,"This app is the best music app I have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like ""Sure thing"" by BLACKPINK and ""Clarity"" by Jisoo...Pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",POSITIVE,-1
478,I used this and it was the best app for music,POSITIVE,-1
479,Crashes on android everytime I go full screen. I thought this was a mature app? Where is quality control?,POSITIVE,-1
480,"App is terrible. It always errors out, crashes, fails to display a toggle bar for whatever you are listening to in order to pause or skip ahead. How can such a big company have such an awful platform.",NEGATIVE,-1
481,It's easy to safe and play my favorite tunes. I have been able to hear and save everything that I requested to listen to.,POSITIVE,-1
482,App is good but had lot of trouble logging in once logged out,NEGATIVE,-1
483,I've been using Spotify since I first started using a phone. I can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when I went to other apps and I'd have to start the song from the beginning again. It happened a couple times and I thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,NEGATIVE,-1
484,Ads are more I am not interested in this app i am deleting it,NEGATIVE,-1
485,Love using Spotify for whatever I like to listen to. Everything about it is AMAZING!! NO faults.,POSITIVE,-1
486,Spotify continues to surprise me with the depth of music available - always uplifts my day!,POSITIVE,-1
487,"Love the app, have had it for years, but I just got a new phone (Galaxy S22), and since then when I use Spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when I start listening, I can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. Obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. Please fix",NEGATIVE,-1
488,User friendly and makes good suggestions,POSITIVE,-1
489,"Highly Recommended. Mostly all the songs available, but, I wish there was some sort of thing in which we could request the songs we wanted to have but, overall it's actually way more better than any other music streaming app I've ever used. The ads are just a misconception. The ads are never TOO MUCH or back to back. They come occasionally which I guess is pretty tolerable for anyone who's not using the premium. Keep up with the good job.",POSITIVE,-1
490,Easy to use able to find the music I enjoy,POSITIVE,-1
491,"The app will not even open anymore. I logged out and since then it stays at the loading screen. I've tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, even tried waiting it out. Nothing. Just a big logo that never goes away.",NEGATIVE,-1
492,Good application for listening music and podcast,POSITIVE,-1
493,"It's a fun app, lots of diversity options.",POSITIVE,-1
494,"I am seriously considering looking for another music streaming aap. For weeks player keeps vanishing. Can't control this aap, pause or stop playing. It's not free application. This is ridiculous.",NEGATIVE,-1
495,This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. There used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. Now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. Also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.,NEGATIVE,-1
496,Compare as ganna Spotify is 10000%best i really love it !! Best app,POSITIVE,-1
497,Just let me view the creators songs not recommended songs. It's so annoying.,NEGATIVE,-1
498,"An offline version should be developed, Meanwhile the app is nice,appreciated.",POSITIVE,-1
499,There is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.,NEGATIVE,-1
500,Cut the ads Good ...........ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º,POSITIVE,-1
501,"WAYYY to restricting! This app annoys me because its literally Forcing me to buy premium. I shuffle in my playlist and it plays a completely different song i havent put in my playlist Its so annoying that i have to shuffle in order to get the song i want to play cause if i click a song, it doesn't even play it. I dont even get the song i wanna play! I only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a HUGGEEE downgrade. Im done with this app.",NEGATIVE,-1
502,"I only really use this app for podcasts. I still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. It's very annoying, happens daily.",NEGATIVE,-1
503,The suggestion according to my mood is amazing.,POSITIVE,-1
504,It did work at first then after a bit it started to play up I tryed unstalling it and installing it again and again and it still wouldn't work I really enjoy the app its just playing up so I just stoped using it,NEGATIVE,-1
505,Best streaming online music app.,POSITIVE,-1
506,I don't know if a bug or not u can open the app but just the logo that u can see I bin waiting for hours bat I can go to the app,NEGATIVE,-1
507,"Queue does not work, it seems it only queues the last song you added to the queue.",NEGATIVE,-1
508,Recently the app just seems to randomly stop and start playback. Often I have to restart the app because none of the playback tools work (it seems to be stuck on playing something) and this playback continues across everything else.,NEGATIVE,-1
509,this app is useless! so many times listening a podcasts and suddenly stopped and can't play it back until restart my phone and so many other issues that u don't expect from a company that big shame on you spotify really.,NEGATIVE,-1
510,It gives me a different song instead of playing what I wanted.,NEGATIVE,-1

512,Application isn't working with wifi,NEGATIVE,-1
513,"I Just Love this app!! It is the absolute ðŸ’¯ best music streaming service!! It allows you to create your own Playlist and will make one for you according to your taste. And has all the oldies, 80's, 90's and many Genres of music. Let's you get up close with the artist without all these hidden fees and Agenda!! And absolutely no commercials which makes me extremely happy!! Now if we could stream our favorite artist on tour or in concert and be able to see and listen live in our homes.ðŸ˜ðŸ˜",POSITIVE,-1
514,Love Spotify it's the best,POSITIVE,-1
515,"broken app, no more 30 mins of uninterrupted listening",NEGATIVE,-1
516,"I hate that i can't listen to what I want. I can't choose a song, and I have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. I also hate limited skips and how Spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. The sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings",NEGATIVE,-1
517,ads more than songs,NEGATIVE,-1
518,Its a good app for music but the ads ðŸ˜… they are very annoying ðŸ˜¡ but I just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,NEGATIVE,-1
519,Really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it,NEGATIVE,-1
520,"it always playing a few songs and 3 ads, and I don't know why",NEGATIVE,-1
521,Awesome experience on Spotify!,POSITIVE,-1

524,i just downloaded and it's stuck on the screen with the logo. fix this please! I haven't even logged on :'(,NEGATIVE,-1
525,"Love the app, always have. However, it's been nothing but issues recently. The ""now playing"" info doesn't show. So I can't pause or skip music. It also stops randomly and I have to close the app and go back in and press play again to start over the playlist since I can't just continue with no ""now playing"" bar.",NEGATIVE,-1
526,Excellent app for music lovers,POSITIVE,-1
527,I open the app just wont load so I can login why is that ?,NEGATIVE,-1
528,"I am a paid subscriber and have been using Android OS for >12 years; I know all the tricks. I cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the OS app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. Unacceptable for a paid app.",NEGATIVE,-1
529,Overall the app is pretty good except that its a bit confusing on a phone rather than on a laptop. I also don't like how on a phone you can't choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. Please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to purchase premium.,NEGATIVE,-1
530,Best music app so far. I am a premium customer.,POSITIVE,-1
531,"After the update, Spotify doesn't load. It is stuck on the logo. I hope there is an immediate response regarding this issue. Thank you.",POSITIVE,-1

542,Spotify music app is very useful to attract people makes them for relation and happy. ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ»ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽ§ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ðŸ§§ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‰,POSITIVE,-1
543,Normally would've given this app 5 stars but I didn't because of the following reason: -Apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. The shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. You'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. What doesn't make sense is why I don't have this issue on my tablet but I do on my phone. Can't loop either. Please fix this issue.,NEGATIVE,-1
544,"Easier to use than Pandora for sure, the skip limit on here is bigger too",NEGATIVE,-1
